## Landing Zone architecture(s)

This landing zone is designed for an NC2 on AWS with [**Nutanix Flow Networking**](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/solutions/details?targetId=TN-2028-Nutanix-Cloud-Clusters-on-AWS:flow-virtual-networking-on-aws.html) integration available in AOS 6.8 or more.

<img width='800' src='./images/NC2-AWS-S2S.png'/>  

IP ranges can be defined/customized by editing [example-configuration.tfvars](example-configuration.tfvars). Then rename example-configuration.tfvars to configuration.tfvars

A [VPC Endpoint S3 Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) can be enabled to make the solution more cost effective for secure, private acces. Traffic from your VPC to S3 is routed directly via AWSâ€™s internal network, which can result in lower latency and higher throughput compared to going through an internet gateway or NAT device.

This landing zone also include the option to have a dedicated private subnet and a virtual machine to use as a jumbox (with an Elastic Load Balancer to access it from Internet). All AWS resources related to Jumbox are in [jumbox.tf](jumbox.tf) file.


## Step by step operations

Clone this repo.

Edit [example-configuration.tfvars](example-configuration.tfvars) to define your AWS resources names or tags, your AWS region, AMI for Jumpbox Virtual Machine... Then rename example-configuration.tfvars to configuration.tfvars

<img width='800' src='./images/configurationtfvars.png'/> 

**Important** DO NOT USE 192.168.5.0/24 CIDR that is reserved for communications between AHV and the CVM


To get these information, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your workstation or in [AWS Cloud Shell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/)

You can list your AWS regions available using the following command :

```bash
aws ec2 describe-regions --output table
```
<img width='800' src='./images/GetAvailableRegions.png'/> 

The following command gives the region actually used by the CLI regardless of whether environment variables are or are not set:

```bash
aws configure get region
```

Finally check your defautl AWS credential in ~/.aws/credentials

<img width='800' src='./images/CheckAWSregion.png'/>  

Check that the region and EC2 metal instance(s) you choose are supported for Nutanix Cloud Cluster : https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Clusters-AWS:aws-clusters-aws-xi-supported-regions-metals.html 

If you don't need a Jumpbox VM and its associated resources, you can delete [jumbox.tf](jumbox.tf) file.

To get AMI ID  for the Windows Server Jumbox in the choosen region :

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images --region eu-central-1 --owners amazon --filters "Name=name,Values=Windows_Server-2025-English-Full-Base-*" "Name=state,Values=available" --query "Images | sort_by(@, &CreationDate) | [-1].ImageId" --output text
```

<img width='800' src='./images/AWSCLI-GetAMIID.png'/>  


Before deploying check on which AWS Account you are connected :

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```


1. Terraform Init phase  

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Terraform Plan phase

```bash
terraform plan --var-file=configuration.tfvars
```

3. Terraform deployment phase (add TF_LOG=info at the beginning of the following command line if you want to see what's happen during deployment)

```bash
terraform apply --var-file=configuration.tfvars
```

<img width='800' src='./images/Terraformdeploy2.png'/>

4. Wait until the end of deployment (It should take around 18 minutes)

<img width='800' src='./images/Terraformdeploy1.png'/>

5. Get the Public IP used for VPN Tunnels on the AWS VPN Gateway

On the AWS Console : 

<img width='800' src='./images/checkpublicipvpntunnelaws.png'/>

Then use this public IP in the on-premises VPN Gateway tunnel configuration.

Example using a Unifi Gateway : 

<img width='800' src='./images/AWSPublicIP-onpremVPNconfig.png'/>

On AWS Console, check that the VPN Tunnel is up

<img width='800' src='./images/CheckVPNtunnelOK.png'/>

On your on premises VPN Gateway management UI, check VPN Tunnel Status :

<img width='800' src='./images/CheckVPNStatusUnifi.png'/>


6. Deploy an EC2 instance in the NC2 VPC (for example in the management subnet) to perform a connectivity test between AWS network and on-premises network

<img width='800' src='./images/CheckIPofEC2instances.png'/>

Check the Security Group defined to open network communications from on premises

<img width='800' src='./images/SGforonpremises.png'/>

Ping the EC2 instance from an on premises device and validate that VPN Site to site is up and running

<img width='800' src='./images/Pingfromonprem.png'/>


7. Go to Nutanix Cloud Cluster (NC2) Portal [https://cloud.nutanix.com](https://cloud.nutanix.com) and start your Nutanix Cluster deployment wizard.

In Step 1 (**General**) choose the same AWS region and Availability Zone that you used in your terraform deployment

<img width='800' src='./images/NC2WizStep1.png'/> 

In Step 4 (**Network**) choose the VPC and Management Subnets created with terraform

<img width='800' src='./images/NC2WizStep4-1.png'/>

<img width='800' src='./images/NC2WizStep4-2.png'/>

In Step 6 (**Prism Central**) choose the PC Subnet and FVN (Flow Virtual Networking) subnet created with terraform

<img width='800' src='./images/NC2WizStep6.png'/> 

8. After the deployment of the cluster is successfull, you can add connectivity with on-premises or other AWS VPC or services by peering [a Transit VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/transit-vpc-option.html) . If you enabled a bastion and a Jumpbox VM, you can login to the Jumbox VM and connect Prism Element or Prism Central through a web browser.

9. Use the solution and configure Nutanix features like categories, VM, replication...

10. When you want to destroy the Nutanix Cluster, use the NC2 Portal (https://cloud.nutanix.com) to terminate it.

11. After Nutanix cluster terminaison, you can destroy the landing zone using the following command : 
```bash
terraform destroy --var-file=configuration.tfvars
```

## How much does it cost to test this landing zone ?

It's very cheap to test and customize this simple landing zone.

You can use **infracost** (available on https://www.infracost.io/) to check the estimate price for 1 month. Here is an example for Ireland (eu-west-1) AWS Region without enabling EC2 Jumbox.

<img width='800' src='./images/InfracostNC2LDZAWS.png'/> 

 :exclamation: Important : this landing zone cost estimation does not include the cost of AWS EC2 Metal instance(s) used as node(s) in the Nutanix Cluster and network traffic. 
 Please have a look of metal instances prices here : https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/. Pricing is per instance-hour consumed for each instance, from the time an instance is launched until it is terminated or stopped. Each partial instance-hour consumed will be billed per-second for Linux, Windows, Windows with SQL Enterprise, Windows with SQL Standard, and Windows with SQL Web Instances, and as a full hour for all other instance types.
